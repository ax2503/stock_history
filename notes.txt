  The SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE 'file_name' form of SELECT writes 
  the selected rows to a file. The file is created on the
   server host, so you must have the FILE privilege to use this
    syntax. file_name cannot be an existing file, which among
     other things prevents files such as /etc/passwd and database
      tables from being destroyed. The character_set_filesystem 
      system variable controls the interpretation of the file name.
